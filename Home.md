## Project and Contributing

What can you do to help improve this project? It's not just about code:
* Help out others and propose new ideas in [issues](https://github.com/Acly/krita-ai-diffusion/issues) and [discussions](https://github.com/Acly/krita-ai-diffusion/discussions)
* Experiment and test new techniques and models and post your results. A systematic evaluation helps to figure out if it's worth to integrate,
  what the best way is, and if it should replace existing functionality.
* Documentation, guides and tutorials are appreciated. Advice and workflows on how to achieve best results can also be added to this Wiki.
* [Contributing Guidelines](https://github.com/Acly/krita-ai-diffusion/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md) - For working on the codebase
* [Project Vision](Project-Vision) - Explains the focus of this project and where it is headed. This is just a direction though, not a constraint!
